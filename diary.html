            <h1>You are the student you wish you were</h1>
            <p>Visualize this: <br/><br/>You are the student you wish you were…<br/><br/>Instead of reaching for that snooze button on your alarm, you wake up straight away.<br/><br/>You don’t even think what to wear today, because you prepared your clothes the night before.<br/><br/>Instead of racing out the door, you have time for a proper breakfast.<br/><br/>You arrive at University early, before most of the world is awake.<br/><br/>It’s peaceful and for the first time in a while, you feel calm.<br/><br/>You are confident about your day because you have planned the week in advance.<br/><br/>You know that today won’t be easy, but you don’t care, because if you want to reach your goals you expect it to be challenging.<br/><br/>Discipline will get you through the day, and every other day this semester.<br/><br/>You find a nice quiet spot in the library and settle in. You have found your place of focus.<br/><br/>You open your laptop and organize your books. By now, you know the drill - study, break, study, lunch, study, relaxation.<br/><br/>Six hours of dedicated study and then the evening is all yours.<br/><br/>You repeat to yourself, ‘quality over quantity, quality over quantity’. Its now lunch time and the sun is shining. You want to enjoy your break so you take a walk through the park, listening to music and thinking how free you feel in this moment.<br/><br/>The cool air on your face, and the sun on your shoulders.<br/><br/>You are so relaxed you almost forget it’s time for your afternoon study session, so you walk back to the library to your place of focus.<br/><br/>You are refreshed and ready to learn. All focus directed on the important concepts and taking your own personalized notes.<br/><br/>The next time you look at your watch it’s nearly time for you to finish. Time passes fast when you are in your state of flow.<br/><br/>Before you finish, you review and recall your notes, because you know that repetition works.<br/><br/>You've now finished your studying, but there is one more important thing that you always do…<br/><br/>Write down the important tasks for tomorrow, so you can build on today's success.<br/><br/>As you walk out of the library the sun is beginning to set. You are calm, just how you started the day.<br/><br/>But this time, you know that you have the rest of the night all for yourself.<br/><br/>You are the student you wish you were.</p>
